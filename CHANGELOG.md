All notable changes are listed here. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/);
before 1.0, minor versions may change the data model.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-08

First tracked release.

### Added
- **Evidence ledger.** Engagements, assets and lanes (host × methodology lane) with
  checklist items. Evidence is append-only and hash-chained per engagement.
- **Fail-closed gates.** An item is done only with evidence, and N/A needs a reason.
  A lane closes with a receipt (manifest hash), and any later change voids the receipt.
  A lane opens only when the lanes it depends on are receipted.
- **Methodology packs.** `bug-bounty` (7 lanes) and `web-pentest-wstg` (97 OWASP WSTG
  tests), with indicative mapping to PCI DSS v4.0, ISO/IEC 27001:2022 and DORA controls.
- **Recon engine.** A worker runs subfinder, dnsx and httpx. Jobs are refused without
  a scope, a recorded authorization and, for target traffic, the research header or
  user agent. Scope is re-checked on every target and every result.
- **Audit report.** JSON and printable HTML. `tools/verify_report.py` verifies it
  offline (body hash, evidence chain, receipts).
- **Web UI.** Recon, Ledger, Controls and Report views, with dark mode.
- **Release gate.** `tools/release_gate.sh` blocks publishing private target names,
  open-finding fingerprints, personal paths and secrets.

### Known limitations
- No database migrations yet. Schema changes require a fresh database.
- Reports are not signed. Verification proves internal consistency, not authorship.
- No authentication on the API. Bind to localhost only (the default).
